# Blinkit-Clone
Blinkit is an Indian instant delivery service. It was founded in December 2013 and is based out of Gurgaon. Customers of the company use a mobile application to order groceries and essentials online. Blinkit's employees then secure the items from their warehouse and deliver the items to the consumers.

I worked on this project focused maily on developing the front end part of the website.
